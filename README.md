# Conversational_chatbot_with_memory

This project is a Streamlit-based conversational chatbot that leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT models via LangChain to provide an interactive chat experience with memory. The chatbot maintains the context of the conversation across multiple turns using LangChain's conversation buffer memory, allowing for coherent and context-aware responses. Users can customize key model parameters such as temperature and maximum tokens through an intuitive sidebar interface. The app requires an OpenAI API key for access and features a clean UI that clearly differentiates between user inputs and AI responses. This solution is ideal for anyone looking to build a simple yet powerful conversational AI with persistent context in a lightweight web app.
